# Learn

A personal learning repository that collects notes, experiments, and references across projects and technologies. This repository is organized as a lightweight monorepo of markdown docs and small demos to help document what I learn while building and exploring.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a single place to:

- Capture practical notes and how-tos
- Store small project examples and configurations
- Keep links to external resources and walkthroughs
- Share reproducible steps for experiments
